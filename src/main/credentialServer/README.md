# Credential Helper Server protocol

This server isn't intended to be used publicly;
it's for other tools that we use in order to find docker credentials.

The protocol is described at [https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers#development](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers#development).
